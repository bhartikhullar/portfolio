        <p><b>Curriculum</b><br>
            Develop and implement units and lessons based on standards, materials available, student interest, and cross-curricular subjects.
            
            Create lessons that are founded in the Common Core State Standards, and challenge students to apply basic concepts to real-world contexts.
            <br><br>Promote literacy, critical-thinking, problem solving, collaboration and applications to everyday life for all students.
          <br> <b>Assessment</b> <br>
            Apply varied assessment methods to measure the knowledge gained by students and to improve student learning.
            
          <br> <b>Summative Assessment </b> including use of pre and post tests to show growth and mastery of a concept.
            <br><b>Formative Assessment</b> to assess the need for adjustment in instruction to increase student learning.
            Example: When results of an exit slip showed students did not grasp the desired concept, instructional plans were adjusted. Using a different approach allowed students to learn the material, ensuring the method of instruction wasn’t what made the topic difficult.
            <br><b>Informal Assessment</b> – ongoing monitoring to evaluate student comprehension and modifying lesson plans as needed.
            Example: When a quick check on a whiteboard revealed students didn’t understand the lesson’s objective, instead of moving on I adjusted and revisited the topic through another method.
            <br><b>Student Formative Self-Assessment </b>to allow students to reflect on their own understanding of the lesson’s learning goal. (Master's Action-Based Research Project).
            Example: Allowed students to think and write about their understanding of a math lesson, explain their strategies and reasoning to solve problems and their communication of a solution.
            <br><b>Standardized or Norm Tests</b>, such as MAP testing or STAR testing, that use data to determine what needs to be a focus for instructional material.
            Example: Using MAP data to identify areas of improvement for Math and ELA standards, I designed and implemented units to develop these skills. For example, a unit focused on text structure and genre improved students’ MAP scores, and use of a common formative assessment as a pre and post-test showed students had a greater understanding of structural elements of text genres.
            Example: Reviewed STAR math and reading scores to see areas of weakness and strength in these subjects, as well as to determine how to group students based on ability, and to adjust groups as student understanding changes. After administering STAR test multiple times throughout the year, data showed average student growth increased by a grade level.</p>>
